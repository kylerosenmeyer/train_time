# train_time
Coding Bootcamp HW7 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Master Train Scheduler** is a train scheduling app built by Kyle Rosenmeyer. It displays an upcoming schedule of trains and wait times, and allows the user to add new train schedules to the page.

This app is useful to learn the principals of using firebase to store and retrieve data, as well as learning time calculations using the moment.js library.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
